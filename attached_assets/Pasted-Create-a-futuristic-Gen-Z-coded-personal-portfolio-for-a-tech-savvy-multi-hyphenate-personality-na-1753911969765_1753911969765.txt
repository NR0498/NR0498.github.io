Create a futuristic, Gen Z-coded personal portfolio for a tech-savvy, multi-hyphenate personality named Nayan, a 3rd-year Computer Science student from SRM Chennai. He’s deeply involved in AI, ML, Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, and Satellite Development (SRM SAT under ex-ISRO guidance). He’s also on a journey of fitness, emotional intelligence, independence, and is a pop-culture nerd with ADHD energy.
